Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver using White Shark Optimizer (WSO) Algorithm

This repository contains the code implementation of a novel approach to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the White Shark Optimizer (WSO) algorithm. The TSP is a widely studied combinatorial optimization problem, and the WSO algorithm is a swarm intelligence algorithm inspired by the hunting strategies of white sharks. 

The proposed approach represents each city in the TSP as an individual particle within the WSO swarm, and incorporates modifications to the algorithm, including a customized velocity update function that mimics the wavy movement patterns of sharks. These adaptations aim to improve the algorithm's ability to explore and exploit the solution space efficiently.

The code has been developed and tested using MATLAB, a powerful programming environment for scientific computing. It leverages the capabilities of MATLAB to implement the WSO algorithm, fine-tune its parameters, and evaluate its performance on benchmark TSP instances.

The results of the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified WSO algorithm in finding high-quality solutions for the TSP, outperforming traditional algorithms in terms of solution quality while maintaining competitive computation times.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different TSP instances. This project serves as a foundation for future research in applying the WSO algorithm to other optimization and machine learning problems. Your feedback and contributions are welcome.
